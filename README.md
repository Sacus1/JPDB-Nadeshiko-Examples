## How It Works  

The script searches **Nadeshiko** for examples based on the current vocabulary and embeds them into **jpdb.io**. Audio can be played manually or automatically.  

### **Audio Playback Note**  
If autoplay doesn't work, check your browser's site settings (click the lock icon next to the URL) and allow automatic audio playback.
